## Mathematical record of the circle equation

Where point  _( h, k )_ is the center of the circle and r is the radius.

So if we have circle **_A_** with center **_(A<sub>x</sub>, A<sub>y</sub>)_** , radius **_r_**
and circle **_B_** with center **_(B<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>y</sub>)_** , radius **_R_**
the equation will look like this

In response, we expect two points. The condition is the distance between the centers must be smaller or equals than the sum of radiuses.
