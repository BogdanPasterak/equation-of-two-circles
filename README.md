## Mathematical record of the circle equation

$$
(x-h)^2+ (y-k)^2= r^2
$$

Where point  ( h, k ) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.

So if we have circle $A$ with center $(A_x, A_y)$ , radius $r$
and circle $B$ with center $(B_x, B_y)$ , radius $R$
the equation will look like this

$$
\begin{cases}
(x-A_x)^2+ (y-A_y)^2= r^2\\
(x-B_x)^2+ (y-B_y)^2= R^2
\end{cases}
$$
